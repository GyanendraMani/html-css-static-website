## Introduction.
In website uses #HTML and #CSS, a fully responsive HTML & CSS website with animations!
 
I followed these things in this code:
- Use CSS variables
- Import CSS files into other CSS files
- Use flex and position properties in CSS
- Create smooth and subtle animations
- Use the BEM naming method
- Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure
-  Embrace the principles of writing clean code
